    <section class="mission-statement">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Flow State is a local nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring that every community in North Carolina has access to clean, potable water. We focus our efforts in Robeson and Brunswick Counties, partnering with residents and local agencies to restore trust in tap water and provide sustainable solutions.

    <!--About Section-->
    <section class="about-details">
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            The Flow State was founded to tackle one simple injustice: safe drinking water should not depend on where you live. We pilot localized solutions in Robeson and Brunswick Counties—free private-well testing, subsidized filter installations, and navigation support for line extensions to public systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working hand-in-hand with neighbors, local health departments, and academic partners, we combine rapid response and long-term advocacy so families can spend less on bottled water and more on living. Our approach centers on listening to community priorities, documenting impact, and scaling what works.
