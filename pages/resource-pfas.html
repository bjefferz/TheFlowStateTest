      <h1>What Are PFAS? Understanding Forever<br> Chemicals, Regulations and More </h1>

      <P>
        What are PFAS? PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a large group of widely used,<br> human-made chemicals. Commonly referred to as “forever chemicals”, they are extremely resistant <br>to breaking down in the environment and in the human body. This persistence leads to long-term <br>buildup and accumulation over time. PFAS are used in a wide range of consumer products, as well as <br>in industrial and manufacturing processes, primarily for their ability to repel water, oil, grease, and <br>stains. These chemicals can also travel through the environment, meaning direct contact with a <br>contamination source is not required for exposure. PFAS can move through soil, water, and air,<br> contributing to widespread global contamination and making cleanup efforts complex and costly.</P>



      <h3 class="Resat">What Should We Know About PFAS?</h3>

      <p>PFAS are found worldwide, and most people have been exposed to at least low levels of these <br>chemicals. Current research suggests that exposure to certain types or higher concentrations of <br>PFAS may be linked to various health concerns, including increased cholesterol, high blood <br>pressure, weakened immune functions, reduced fertility, and other potential effects. Ongoing <br>studies continue to examine how different PFAS compounds affect the body, how exposure levels <br>correlate with health outcomes, and what long-term, low-level exposure may mean for individuals<br> over time. Scientists are still working to better understand the full scope of health risks associated <br>with these persistent chemicals.</p>



      <h3 class="Resat">What can we do?</h3>

      <p>Although completely eliminating PFAS exposure is unlikely, individuals can take meaningful steps to <br>reduce personal risk. Contaminated drinking water is currently considered one of the most significant <br>exposure pathways. To better understand your own risk, consider testing your water. Local health <br>departments, water utilities, or environmental protection agencies can provide certified testing kits <br>that allow you to collect samples and send them to an accredited laboratory. Because PFAS require a <br>highly sensitive analytical method—liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)<br>—simple at home test kits cannot accurately detect them. While awaiting results, or as a general <br>precaution, using a water filtration system can help. Activated carbon filters and reverse osmosis <br>systems are the most effective at reducing PFAS levels, and several water pitchers are specifically <br>designed to filter PFAS. In addition, reducing your use of PFAS-containing products can help limit <br>exposure. Avoid items containing PTFE or other fluorinated chemicals, and consider choosing long-<br>lasting, reusable products instead of disposable ones.</p>
