      <h1>Understanding Agriculture and Urban Runnoff</h1>

      <P>Agricultural and urban runoff are major sources of water pollution and originate from a wide range of <br>activities. Agricultural runoff occurs when water from rainfall or irrigation flows over farmland,<br> carrying with it pollutants such as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, animal waste, and sediment into<br> nearby waterways. Urban runoff forms when rain or melting snow flows over streets, parking lots, and<br> other paved surfaces, collecting contaminants such as oil, grease, chemicals, metals, and trash. <br>Urban runoff can also overwhelm drainage systems, contributing to localized flooding. Both forms of <br>runoff can significantly degrade water quality, harming aquatic ecosystems and creating unsafe<br> conditions for human use. These impacts highlight the importance of effective runoff management to <br>protect drinking water sources, recreational areas, and environmental health.</P>


      <h3 class="Resat">What is runoff management?</h3>

      <p>Runoff management involves reducing, controlling, and treating stormwater to minimize pollution and <br>lower the risk of flooding. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supports <br>these efforts through stormwater management programs that address runoff from both agricultural <br>and urban areas. Many cities and counties partner with the EPA to maintain storm drainage systems, <br>enforce local regulations, implement pollution-prevention strategies, and develop community <br>projects. The most accurate way to understand your county or city’s runoff management practices is <br>to visit their official website. These sites typically provide information on local regulations, project <br>maps, stormwater plans, and public outreach events or meetings. Local environmental agencies and <br>municipal departments often collaborate closely and are available to offer public education and <br>resources.</p>


      <h3 class="Resat">What can you do at home?</h3>

      <p>The community can also plays an important role in reducing runoff pollution, simple actions such as <br>properly disposing chemicals, painting vehicles to prevent any leakage. You can also keep pollutants<br> from washing into drains by installing a rain barrel, creating rain gardens and placing gutter guards,<br> and keeping up maintaince with your gutter. These small steps can significantly reduce the amount <br>of pollution entering our local waterways and contribute to a better environment.</p>
