      <h2>The Safe Drinking Water Act</h2>
      <p>The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the primary law that protects public drinking water in the United States. It sets standards for <br>water quality, requires regular testing, and regulates how public water systems treat and manage drinking water. The act also authorizes<br> the EPA to oversee states and water suppliers to ensure water remains safe. You can access the full document using the link provided<br> below.</p>

      <h2>Brunswisk County</h2>
      <p>These water issues are not just national concerns—they are actively affecting <br>communities such as Brunswick County, North Carolina. Recent testing has<br> shown that portions of the county’s drinking water contain elevated levels of <br>PFAS, including compounds that are not yet fully regulated at the federal <br>level. Local utilities are working to upgrade their treatment systems, including <br>the addition of advanced filtration technologies, to reduce these “forever <br>chemicals” and meet new safety guidelines. The county’s population growth <br>has also placed additional pressure on water supply and infrastructure,<br> leading to seasonal conservation alerts and a greater reliance on treatment<br> facilities to ensure safe &reliable water to the people.</p>

      <h2>Robeson County</h2>
      <p>Robeson County faces its own water-quality challenges, many of which are<br> linked to PFAS contamination. Recent testing has identified elevated PFAS <br>levels in parts of the county’s water system and in areas near landfills and <br>industrial sites. The region’s frequent flooding and extensive agricultural <br>activity also make it especially vulnerable to runoff, allowing fertilizers, waste, <br>and other pollutants to enter nearby waterways. Combined with aging <br>infrastructure in some communities, these factors underscore the importance<br> of reliable water testing and strong treatment practices to ensure long-term<br> water safety.</p>
