                <h2>WHY WE’RE HERE</h2>

                <p>Across North Carolina, several communities still struggle to access safe and reliable drinking water. At The Flow State, we’re committed to changing that with one drop, one home, one community at a time. As a local nonprofit organization, we create our digital hub for residents and supporters. We connect people to trusted resources, volunteer opportunities, and transparent ways to give back. Because we believe that when water flows, communities thrive.</p>
